##  Project Overview
The **ITI Examination System** is a comprehensive platform designed to manage examination processes efficiently. It includes a well-structured database, automated data generation, robust data integrity measures, and advanced reporting through SSRS and Power BI. The system also features a desktop application built with C# to enhance user interaction.

##  Features
- **Database Design:** 
  - Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for structured database modeling.
  - Well-defined relational database schema covering students, courses, exams, results, instructors, and other key entities.
- **Data Generation:**
  - Automated insertion of generated data for testing and validation.
  - Sample dataset with realistic values for effective simulations.
- **Stored Procedures:**
  - Implemented constraints to ensure data integrity and consistency.
  - Functions for handling exam scheduling, grading automation, and student performance analysis.
- **Reporting & Visualization:**
  - **SSRS Reports:** Predefined reports covering exam results, student performance, instructor effectiveness, and overall statistics.
  - **Power BI Dashboards:** 20 interactive dashboards providing insights into various aspects of the system, including:
    - **Student Enrollment Trends** – Visualizing the number of students per course and year.
    - **Exam Participation Rates** – Tracking student attendance for exams.
    - **Overall Pass/Fail Rate** – Analyzing student success rates.
    - **Average Scores by Course** – Comparing performance across different courses.
    - **Instructor Performance Analysis** – Evaluating the impact of instructors on student outcomes.
    - **Course Popularity Trends** – Identifying the most enrolled courses.
    - **Exam Difficulty Analysis** – Measuring difficulty based on average scores.
    - **Student Performance by Semester** – Examining trends over multiple semesters.
    - **Top-Performing Students** – Listing students with the highest scores.
    - **Lowest-Performing Students** – Identifying students who need academic support.
    - **Department-Wise Performance** – Analyzing student results across departments.
    - **Exam Retake Analysis** – Monitoring students who have repeated exams.
    - **Time Taken Per Exam** – Measuring average duration spent by students.
    - **Comparison of Online vs Offline Exams** – Evaluating performance differences.
    - **Student Engagement Metrics** – Tracking student participation in different activities.
    - **Dropout Analysis** – Identifying trends in student dropouts.
    - **Score Distribution Across Courses** – Viewing score distribution patterns.
    - **Real-Time Exam Monitoring** – Live tracking of ongoing exams.
    - **Certification & Completion Rates** – Analyzing certificate issuance rates.
    - **Custom KPI Dashboard** – Allowing admin users to configure key performance indicators.

- **Desktop Application:**
  - Developed using **C#** to facilitate user interaction and system management.
  - Features include student registration, exam scheduling, result processing, and report generation.
